An overview about the code for fRG+DMFT
The python files can be used to generate a self-energy for a given parameter set in the 2D or 3D case. The "impurity" parameter of the function GetSigma determines the strength of an impurity situated at the center of a chain.
The notebook is there to calculate the LDOS for a precalculated self-energy.
